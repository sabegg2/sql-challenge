Module 9 Challenge

In the EmployeeSQL folder, I have included:

(1) An image file of the Entity_Relationship_Diagram from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#.

(2) An image file of the Entity Relationship Diagram_Documentation from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#.

(3) A Data_Engineering.sql file of my table schemata. Used the PostgreSQL output from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ as a starter for my Data_Engineering.sql.

(4) A Data_Analysis.sql file of my queries. 

I also checked that the primary keys were all unique. The code for this is the checkunique.ipynb notebook file in the data folder.
