Module 9 Challenge

In the EmployeeSQL folder, I have included:

(1) An image file of the Entity_Relationship_Diagram from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#.
![Entity_Relationship_Diagram.png](EmployeeSQL/Entity_Relationship_Diagram.png?raw=true)

(2) A pdf of the [Entity_Relationship_Diagram_Documentation.pdf](EmployeeSQL/Entity_Relationship_Diagram_Documentation.pdf) from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#.

(3) A [Data_Engineering3.sql](EmployeeSQL/Data_Engineering3.sql) file of my table schemata. Used the PostgreSQL output from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ as a starter for my Data_Engineering.sql.

(4) A [Data_Analysis.sql](EmployeeSQL/Data_Analysis.sql) file of my queries. 

Query 1: List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

Query 8: List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

I also checked that the primary keys were all unique in the respective tables. The code for this is the [checkunique.ipynb](data/checkunique.ipynb) notebook file in the data folder.
